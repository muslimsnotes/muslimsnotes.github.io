## Introduction
Prophet Abraham (peace be with him) plays a pivotal role among the Jews, the Christians, and the Muslims. The said prophet is adhered by the three groups and serves as the common ground between the three religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The Old Testament as believed by the Jews and the Christians has detailed accounts on the life of Prophet Abraham, which to some extent is similar to the accounts given in the Qur’an. For example, the story of Abraham in Genesis 18:1-15 is more or less similar to Qur’an 11:69-74, which is about the good news of a son for Sarah, the wife of Abraham. The Bible clearly states that the group who visited Abraham was composed of three men, whereas the Qur’an simply states the group as messengers or honored guests (see Qur’an 51:24), which according to various accounts is composed of three, ten, or twelve angels, one of whom was Gabriel, see commentary of Qur’an 51:24-25 p. 1276 of Hossein (2010). In relation to this, the Bible, unlike the Qur’an, is not clear about the relationship of God to the three men who visited Abraham, see commentary of Genesis 18:1-5 p. 35 of Coogan (2018). Despite these differences, one can more or less confirm the similarity of the stories between the Qur’an and the Bible.

Furthermore, the similarities do not stop there, it can also be said for the stories of Prophet Moses and other prophets (may peace be with them all). For example, the story of the Golden Calf during the time of Prophet Moses in Exodus 32:1-6 is also reflected in Qur’an 20:85-91, although there is a glaring difference in this case, with the Bible portraying Prophet Aaron as the main proponent in the creation of the Golden Calf, which is in great contrast with the Qur’an, which portrayed Prophet Aaron as the one who warned the Israelites to fear God from creating the Golden Calf. Interestingly, when God got angry in Exodus 32, He was persuaded and reminded by Prophet Moses, which resulted in God following Moses instead. These are just some of the similarities and differences, but the main point here is that the fact that there are similarities simply suggest that the core message of the Qur’an should also be expected or at least can be traced in these scriptures. In fact, the Qur’an tells the Muslims to refer to the People of the Book should they doubt the Qur’an, see Qur’an 10:94 below:

<div class="quran-wrapper">
    <div class="quran-verse">
        <div class="quran">
            فَإِن كُنتَ فِى شَكٍّ مِّمَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ فَسْـَٔلِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقْرَءُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَقَدْ جَآءَكَ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ
        </div>
        <div class="translation">
            So if you [Prophet] are in doubt about what We have revealed to you, ask those who have been reading the scriptures before you. The Truth has come to you from your Lord, so be in no doubt and do not deny God's signs ---

If one ponders on the above verse, it simply suggests that in order to confirm the teachings of the Qur’an, then one must refer to the People of the Book who have been reading the scriptures before the Qur’an. Consequently, some of the Christians used the above verse to argue that the Bible is the truth since the Qur’an itself points into the scriptures in the Bible, which are the Torah and the Gospels, as its reference. The problem with this is that the core definition on the nature of God in Christianity who adheres to the Bible is strikingly different from that of the Islam’s Tawhid. Tawhid is the Islamic word for the absolute unity of God, which in this paper is posited as the core message delivered to the People of the Book. 

To elaborate on the nature of God in Christianity, Christians believed that God the Father is not the only true God, since God the Son and God the Holy Spirit are also considered true Gods. All three Gods are one in essence but are distinct, and define what they call as the Trinity. This is clearly different from Tawhid. So the question now is, if the Christians who teach the content of the Bible do not adhere to Tawhid, how is that the Qur’an points the Muslims to the People of the Book? If the Tawhid was indeed the core message delivered to the People of the Book, where can we find it in the Old Testament and the New Testament? Further, if there is indeed such evidence, then what events took place that led to the difference in belief between Christianity and Islam? How does the Christian then interpret such verses on Tawhid in the Bible? What counter-arguments do they bring up in interpreting these verses? Can we more or less do an objective analysis to come up with a well-backed-up conclusion? What type of analysis should we conduct then?

Furthermore, in order to manage the scope of this paper, the work will focus only on Tawhid as the core message delivered to the People of the Book. This is contrasted against the mainstream Christian opinion of God in the Bible as Triuned in nature. Needless to say, there are other Christian denominations who adhere to Absolute Unity of God, as in Tawhid, but there are others adhere to the duality of God, or even to quadrupled God's head as in the case of Church of God movement founded in South Korea. 

In relation to this, this article will also relate the belief of the Muslims to that of the Jews, specifically to the nature of God. The paper therefore attempts to address as well the similarities of the two religions, but skips the discussions on the differences as this will widen significantly the scope of the paper, and partly because these differences has something to do with the prophethood of Prophet Muhammad, which is outside the topic of Tawhid.

Moving on, while there have been works addressing this topic, some of them are usually with polemic intentions against other religions. Such intention is greatly discouraged in this article, as it aims to be objective as much as possible. In addition to this, the paper not only presents the evidence but also attempts to address the counter-arguments regarding the interpretation supporting Tawhid or the core message in the Bible. Lastly, and at least to the best knowledge of the author, not a single book on this topic is presented in an objective manner, or in a way where one can easily quantify or at least give a score to a particular claim. 

In the succeeding sections, the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is the Related Literature discussing articles or books related in this topic; Section 3 discusses the Methodology; and, Section 4 presents the Results and Discussions; finally, Section 5 is the conclusion and recommendation for future study.

## Related Literature
There are several ways to do comparative analyses for the Bible and the Qur’an, one such approach is to simply compare the content of the two from a linguistic perspective. Another way is to compare the two in terms of their extant manuscripts, either by comparing which of the two are consistent in terms of content or by analyzing the orthography unique to them. Finally, the other approach is to compare it based on the religions adhering to it.

As for the comparative analyses that is based on the religions adhering to it, the literatures are often entitled Islam versus Christianity, such a book can be found in the works of Renard (2011) which aims to put forward a selective overview of the major theological themes between the two. Indeed, it does not delve into the argument of Muslims’ claims on the Tawhid that is believed by them was revealed to the Christians before. Instead, Renard (2011) simply gives a good start for any curious scholar on the differing theological belief of the two religions, whose histories are also well laid out by Renard (2011). Moving on, the work of
