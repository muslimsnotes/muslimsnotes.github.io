Assalamu ‘Alaikum (Peace be with you), may peace and blessings of the Almighty God be with you. If I said something that might go against you in the following discussion, I would like to sincerely ask for forgiveness. I know this topic is quite sensitive to discuss, but I will try my best to be respectful as much as possible. Thank you.

Both the Jews and Muslims worship the same concept of God, an Absolute Monotheism (see here and here). However, unique to Christianity is the definition of God. They believe that God the Father is not the only true God, since God the Son and God the Holy Spirit are also considered true Gods. All three Gods define what they call as the Trinity. Moreover, Chritianity is built on top of Judaism, thus we can say that Christians consider the Old Testament as their reference truth, and they use this to justify their claims in the New Testament. This is indeed the interest of the paper.

To formally state the objective of this work, my main goal in this paper is to validate, in the most honest way, if such a claim on the nature of God is true. Also, I would like to emphasize that the original text of the Bible is nowhere to be found, we only rely on what we have now, which mostly comes from the translations. So, if I use a particular translation below, it doesn’t mean that I favor such a translation, because I would still prefer to learn Hebrew and Aramaic, since these are the language of the prophets and the language which the translations were derived from.

## Universal Truth
As I mentioned, Christianity uses the Old Testament as their reference truth to justify their claims in the New Testament. This simply means that anyone who challenges the claims of the Christians must prove by using the Old Testament as well. Therefore, we can say that the Universal Truth in this perspective can be summarized as follows:

Table 1: Universal truth on the relationship of Old and New Testaments.
